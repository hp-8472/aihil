# Release Strategy

AI-HIL publishes through npm and GitHub Releases. GitHub Releases are the canonical place for ready-to-use versions, release notes, the npm tarball, SBOMs, and artifact attestations.

Do not cut the next release for metadata-only or README-only cleanup. Batch hygiene work into the next release that delivers visible user value.

Use small releases while the project stabilizes, but only when each release has a clear user-facing reason:

```text
0.2.0  stable npm installation, CI, publishable package checks, documented golden path
0.3.0  demo hardening and at least one additional substantial workflow improvement
```

After `0.3.0`, use monthly or bi-monthly SemVer releases with GitHub auto-generated release notes.

## Versioning

Use SemVer for user-visible behavior:

```text
patch  docs, metadata, packaging hygiene, compatible bug fixes
minor  new MCP tools, new supported workflows, compatible config additions
major  breaking CLI, config, MCP, or report schema changes
```

Keep releases small enough that each one has a clear theme and an obvious rollback path.

## Release Notes

Each GitHub Release should include:

```text
what changed
how to install or upgrade
validated workflows
known limitations
links to relevant docs
```

Npm remains the primary installation channel. Add downloadable binary artifacts later only when they are reproducible and built by CI.

## Distribution Channels

Use npm first. AI-HIL is currently a Node.js CLI with TypeScript builds and a package `bin` mapping.

Publish npm releases through GitHub Actions trusted publishing with OIDC and provenance. Do not add long-lived npm automation tokens unless trusted publishing is unavailable for a documented reason.

The release dependency tree is frozen with `npm-shrinkwrap.json`. Treat it as the authoritative lockfile for both repository installs and the published CLI package.

Later packaging candidates are Homebrew, Scoop or WinGet, and optional single-file binaries.

## Release Checklist

Before creating a release:

```text
1. Update package.json, npm-shrinkwrap.json, and CHANGELOG.md to the release version.
2. Run npm test.
3. Run npm run shrinkwrap:check.
4. Run npm run audit:prod.
5. Run npm pack --dry-run and inspect the packaged files.
6. Create a strict SemVer vX.Y.Z Git tag that exactly matches package.json.
7. Let the release workflow validate the tag, test, audit, pack, generate SBOM, create attestations, and create the GitHub Release.
8. Confirm the npm publish workflow uses OIDC trusted publishing and provenance.
9. Confirm the version is not already published to npm.
10. Start from GitHub auto-generated release notes, then edit for clarity.
```

## Repository Protection

Keep `master` protected with required status checks for CI, CodeQL, Dependency Review, and Scorecards. Do not enable required human approvals while the project has only one maintainer, because that can make routine releases impossible to merge. Enable required reviews and stale-review dismissal once a second maintainer is available.

Recommended branch protection settings today:

```text
require pull requests before merging
require status checks before merging
require branches to be up to date before merging
block force pushes
block branch deletion
do not require approval count > 0 until a second maintainer exists
```
