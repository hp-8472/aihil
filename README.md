# AI-HIL

**AI-HIL makes it possible for AI agents to work on real embedded hardware.**

AI can already write firmware. The hard part is the embedded feedback loop: build, flash, reset, observe, diagnose, and improve based on what actually happens on a real board.

AI-HIL is a local bridge between an AI agent and an embedded development setup. It does not replace existing tools. It makes tools like OpenOCD usable by AI agents in a controlled, structured, and safe way.

## Note For Engineers

To try this repository with Claude Code, opencode, Codex, or another coding agent, open the firmware project you want to use with AI-HIL and tell the agent:

```text
Install https://github.com/hp-8472/aihil and use it for this firmware project.
```

The agent should install the `aihil` command from this repository, create the project-local `.aihil/` setup in the firmware project, and use the AI-HIL MCP tools for hardware actions.

```text
AI agent
  ↓ MCP
AI-HIL
  ↓ configuration + policy
OpenOCD / debug probe / programmer / COM ports / logs / tests
  ↓
real embedded target
  ↓ structured feedback
AI agent
```

## Quick Start For AI Agents

Install AI-HIL once on the local machine from GitHub with:

```bash
npm i -g hp-8472/aihil
```

From this repository checkout, install with:

```bash
npm install --global .
```

For local repository development and tests, use the Node.js toolchain:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

The `aihil` command is a Node.js CLI. The npm package builds TypeScript during installation and installs the `aihil` executable on `PATH` when installed globally.

If an agent is given only the AI-HIL repository URL and asked to set it up for the current firmware project, it should install AI-HIL with `npm i -g hp-8472/aihil`, read `AGENTS.md`, then follow `skills/aihil-config-setup/SKILL.md` back in the firmware project. Do not vendor the AI-HIL source tree into the firmware project.

Then bootstrap each firmware project separately:

```bash
aihil init
aihil doctor
aihil mcp-config > .mcp.json
```

The installed `aihil` command provides the MCP stdio server. The project-local `.aihil/` directory contains that project's hardware configuration, policy, reports, logs, and artifact roots.

`aihil init` includes detected host serial/COM ports in its JSON output to help fill `com_ports`. Re-run `aihil com-ports` after connecting USB serial hardware if needed.

Each project can include MCP discovery config in `.mcp.json`:

```bash
aihil mcp-config > .mcp.json
```

Example `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aihil": {
      "command": "aihil",
      "args": [
        "mcp-stdio",
        "--config",
        ".aihil/config.yaml"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Agents should use MCP `tools/list` and `tools/call` through the configured stdio server. Do not use raw OpenOCD commands for hardware actions.

## Why this exists

AI-assisted software development works best when the agent can run code and see the result. Embedded development is different: the meaningful result often only exists on real hardware.

Without a hardware bridge, an AI agent can edit firmware but cannot reliably answer questions like:

```text
Did the target flash successfully?
Did the board boot?
What did the UART log say?
Did the firmware crash?
Did the output pin change?
Did the hardware behave differently after the patch?
```

AI-HIL tries to close that gap.

> **AI writes firmware. AI-HIL helps the AI run it on real hardware and understand the result.**

## What this repository is

This repository starts as a free, practical infrastructure project for AI-assisted embedded development.

The first concrete bridge is an **OpenOCD MCP bridge**. It should allow an AI agent to perform a small number of hardware actions safely:

```text
probe target
flash configured firmware
reset target
return structured result
store raw logs
classify common OpenOCD errors
```

The idea is simple:

```text
The AI should not get arbitrary shell access.
The AI should get a small set of safe hardware tools.
```

## What this repository is not

AI-HIL is intentionally not framed as a product here.

It is also not:

```text
a customer SDK
a library customers need to import
a generic OpenOCD shell
a replacement for OpenOCD, J-Link, ST-Link, probe-rs, or vendor tools
a cloud service
a complete HIL system
a pricing or sales story
```

The purpose of this repository is to explore and build the missing bridge between AI agents and real embedded hardware.

## Core idea

AI-HIL is the controlled gate between an AI agent and a local embedded hardware setup.

```text
AI agent
  ↓
AI-HIL MCP interface
  ↓
AI-HIL configuration + policy layer
  ↓
OpenOCD / build tools / UART logs / COM stimuli / hardware actions
  ↓
real target board
```

The agent does not receive unrestricted command execution. It receives explicit tools with narrow responsibilities.

Examples:

```text
aihil_debugger_info
aihil_probe_target
aihil_flash_firmware
aihil_reset_target
aihil_get_last_report
aihil_classify_last_error
aihil_com_ports_list
aihil_com_session_start
aihil_com_write
aihil_com_read
aihil_com_session_stop
```

## MCP and skills

AI-HIL uses both an MCP interface and optional skills, but they have different jobs.

```text
MCP server: performs hardware actions
Skill: explains the workflow to the AI agent
```

For AI-HIL:

```text
MCP = the gate to the hardware
Skill = guidance for the agent
Configuration = the permission boundary
Reports = feedback the agent can reason about
```

A skill does not flash hardware by itself. A skill can teach an agent how to use the available tools properly.

The config setup skill lives at `skills/aihil-config-setup/SKILL.md`. It tells an agent how to create and validate `.aihil/config.yaml` safely:

```text
1. Run aihil init if .aihil/config.yaml is missing.
2. Edit only project-specific fields.
3. Keep raw debugger commands and mass erase disabled.
4. Validate with aihil doctor.
5. Fix config_invalid errors from structured fields.
6. Report debugger availability issues without weakening policy.
```

The actual hardware access remains behind the MCP server.

## First bridge: OpenOCD

OpenOCD is a good first bridge because many embedded developers already use it with ST-Link, CMSIS-DAP, J-Link, FTDI, and other debug probes.

The first AI-HIL bridge should wrap OpenOCD in safe, high-level operations.

Instead of exposing this to the agent:

```text
run arbitrary openocd command
```

AI-HIL exposes this:

```text
probe the configured target
flash the configured image
reset the configured target
return a structured report
```

## Example `.aihil/config.yaml`

`.aihil/config.yaml` belongs to the firmware project that owns the hardware setup. It describes the local target, debugger, allowed artifact roots, and what the AI is allowed to do. Create a starter file in each project with `aihil init`; AI-HIL validates it against the schema bundled with the installed Node.js package.

If an editor or external tool needs a schema file, export the bundled schema with `aihil schema --output config.schema.json`. Runtime validation always uses the schema from the installed package, not a project-local copy.

```yaml
target:
  name: fan-controller-v1
  controller: stm32f4

debugger:
  type: openocd
  executable: openocd
  interface_cfg: "interface/stlink.cfg"
  target_cfg: "target/stm32f4x.cfg"
  timeout_s: 60

artifacts:
  allowed_roots:
    - "build"
  allowed_extensions:
    - ".elf"
    - ".hex"
    - ".bin"

com_ports:
  dut_uart:
    device: "COM5"
    baudrate: 115200
    timeout_s: 0.1
    write_timeout_s: 1.0
    encoding: "utf-8"
    max_buffer_bytes: 65536
    max_write_bytes: 4096

permissions:
  allow_probe: true
  allow_flash: true
  allow_reset: true
  allow_com_read: true
  allow_com_write: true
  allow_raw_debugger_commands: false
  allow_mass_erase: false

reports:
  directory: ".aihil/reports"

logs:
  directory: ".aihil/logs"
```

The configuration file is not just convenience. It is the per-project contract between the human developer, the local hardware setup, and the AI agent.

## Intended MCP tools

### `aihil_debugger_info`

Returns information about the configured debugger backend, including the detected OpenOCD version when available.

### `aihil_probe_target`

Checks whether the configured target can be reached through OpenOCD.

Example result:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "tool": "aihil_probe_target",
  "target_detected": true,
  "elapsed_ms": 1834,
  "summary": "Target detected through OpenOCD."
}
```

### `aihil_flash_firmware`

Flashes a validated firmware image.

The image path must be under a configured allowed artifact root. Raw OpenOCD commands are not exposed to the AI agent.

Example result:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "tool": "aihil_flash_firmware",
  "artifact": {
    "source": "path",
    "path": "build/firmware.elf",
    "sha256": "..."
  },
  "verify": true,
  "reset_after_flash": true,
  "elapsed_ms": 4217,
  "summary": "Firmware flashed, verified, and target reset.",
  "report_path": ".aihil/reports/last-report.json",
  "log_path": ".aihil/logs/openocd-20260624T164357926542Z-aihil_flash_firmware.log"
}
```

### `aihil_reset_target`

Resets the configured target through OpenOCD.

Possible reset modes:

```text
run
halt
init
```

### `aihil_get_last_report`

Returns the most recent structured AI-HIL report.

### `aihil_classify_last_error`

Classifies the most recent OpenOCD failure into a useful category.

Initial error classes:

```text
target_not_detected
adapter_not_found
openocd_not_found
config_file_not_found
firmware_image_not_found
flash_failed
verify_failed
timeout
permission_denied
unknown_openocd_error
```

### `aihil_com_ports_list`

Lists configured named COM ports and their active streaming session status.

### `aihil_com_session_start`

Opens a configured COM port and starts a background reader that continuously buffers feedback.

### `aihil_com_write`

Writes a text or hexadecimal stimulus to an active COM port session. The tool accepts only configured `port_id` values, not arbitrary host devices.

### `aihil_com_read`

Reads buffered feedback from an active COM port session. Results include both `hex` and decoded `text` using the configured encoding.

### `aihil_com_session_stop`

Stops the background reader and closes the configured COM port.

## Plain COM Text Stdio

For LLMs or local tools that need a socket-like text channel instead of MCP tool calls, AI-HIL provides a separate COM stdio mode:

```bash
aihil com-stdio --config .aihil/config.yaml --port dut_uart
```

This mode is not MCP. It is a plain text data plane:

```text
stdin text  -> configured COM port
COM bytes   -> decoded text on stdout
errors      -> stderr
```

`com-stdio` still uses the AI-HIL configuration and permissions. The `--port` value must be a named `com_ports` entry, and the configured `encoding` controls how COM bytes become text. Use `mcp-stdio` for hardware actions and structured reports; use `com-stdio` only when you explicitly want a continuous text conversation with one configured serial port.

## Safety principles

AI-HIL is meant to give AI agents access to real hardware, so the defaults must be conservative.

### No raw OpenOCD access by default

The agent should not be able to execute arbitrary OpenOCD commands.

```text
not exposed: openocd_command("...")
exposed:     aihil_probe_target
exposed:     aihil_flash_firmware
exposed:     aihil_reset_target
```

### Configuration is the permission boundary

The `.aihil/config.yaml` file defines what the agent is allowed to do.

```yaml
permissions:
  allow_flash: true
  allow_reset: true
  allow_com_read: true
  allow_com_write: true
  allow_mass_erase: false
  allow_raw_debugger_commands: false
```

### Firmware paths are restricted

The agent should only flash firmware images from explicitly allowed directories.

```yaml
artifacts:
  allowed_roots:
    - "build"
```

### COM ports are restricted

The agent can open only named COM ports from `.aihil/config.yaml`. It cannot pass arbitrary `COMx` or `/dev/ttyUSBx` values at tool-call time.

```yaml
com_ports:
  dut_uart:
    device: "COM5"
    baudrate: 115200

permissions:
  allow_com_read: true
  allow_com_write: true
```

### Every hardware action returns a report

Every probe, flash, reset, or failure should create a structured report that the agent can reason about.

### Raw logs remain available

Structured reports are for AI agents. Raw OpenOCD and COM port logs are for humans.

## Implementation direction

The first implementation can keep OpenOCD simple by running it as a controlled external process.

Example internal command shape:

```bash
openocd \
  -f interface/stlink.cfg \
  -f target/stm32f4x.cfg \
  -c "program build/firmware.elf verify reset exit"
```

This avoids building a persistent debug session too early.

A later implementation can add a persistent OpenOCD session through the Tcl interface.

No implementation language is fixed in this README. AI-HIL is a host-side bridge, not firmware running on the target. The implementation language should be chosen for reliable local tooling, MCP support, process handling, configuration parsing, and packaging.

## Local usage shape

The main interface for AI agents is MCP over stdio.

The server implementation is installed once as the `aihil` command. The MCP client starts `aihil mcp-stdio` from the firmware project that contains `.aihil/config.yaml`.

`mcp-stdio` is project-scoped and does not take a COM `--port`; individual MCP COM tool calls carry the configured `port_id`. The separate `com-stdio` data plane is port-scoped and therefore requires `--port`.

## MCP client configuration

A local MCP client can connect to AI-HIL as a stdio MCP server.

Example shape:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aihil": {
      "command": "aihil",
      "args": [
        "mcp-stdio",
        "--config",
        ".aihil/config.yaml"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Exact configuration depends on the MCP client.

Do not mix COM text into the MCP stdio process. MCP stdout is JSON-RPC only. If a plain serial text stream is needed, start a separate `aihil com-stdio --config .aihil/config.yaml --port <port_id>` process. Only `com-stdio` needs `--port`; `mcp-stdio` stays project-scoped.

## Example agent loop

```text
Task: Fix the firmware so the target boots correctly.

AI agent:
1. Inspects the firmware code.
2. Changes the code.
3. Builds the firmware.
4. Calls aihil_probe_target.
5. Calls aihil_flash_firmware.
6. Calls aihil_reset_target.
7. Optionally starts a COM port session and exchanges stimuli/feedback with aihil_com_write and aihil_com_read.
8. Reads the AI-HIL report.
9. Uses the hardware result to continue debugging.
```

This is the basic loop AI-HIL tries to enable:

```text
change firmware
→ run on real hardware
→ observe result
→ improve firmware
```

## Design rules

### Keep the agent interface small

Expose a few safe, high-level tools. Do not expose all OpenOCD features.

### Return deterministic output

The agent should receive predictable JSON results, not only raw terminal text.

### Fail usefully

When something fails, return a useful diagnosis.

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error_type": "target_not_detected",
  "summary": "OpenOCD could not detect the target.",
  "likely_causes": [
    "DUT is not powered",
    "wrong interface configuration",
    "SWD/JTAG wiring issue",
    "debug probe already in use"
  ]
}
```

### Do not hide raw logs

Reports are for agents. Logs are for developers.

### Do not become a generic shell

The value of AI-HIL is controlled hardware access, not arbitrary command execution.

## Possible next bridges

OpenOCD and configured COM ports are the first bridges.

Other useful bridges could be:

```text
build-system bridge
hardware smoke-test bridge
measurement bridge
power-control bridge
```

These should follow the same rule:

```text
small safe tools
clear permissions
structured feedback
human-readable logs
```
