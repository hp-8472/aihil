# AI Agent Quickstart

Use AI-HIL as the local MCP server for embedded hardware actions.

This file is for agents. Humans should start with `README.md` and use `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for operator-facing diagnostics.

## Reference Setup

Prefer the supported first path unless the firmware project or user clearly says otherwise:

- STM32 Nucleo-F446RE.
- ST-Link.
- OpenOCD.
- Node.js 16.16 or newer with npm; current Node.js LTS is recommended.
- `interface/stlink.cfg`.
- `target/stm32f4x.cfg`.
- Firmware artifacts under `build/`.

If the board, debugger, COM port, or artifact path cannot be inferred, ask one concise question instead of guessing.

## Install Once

Fast path:

1. If `aihil --version` works, do not reinstall. On Windows, also try `aihil.cmd --version`.
2. If AI-HIL is missing, install the `aihil` command once on the local machine from npm:

```bash
npm i -g aihil
```

3. If the user explicitly asked for the GitHub repo version, or the npm registry package rejects a Node.js version accepted by this repository, install directly from GitHub:

```bash
npm i -g github:hp-8472/aihil
```

Installing from npm or GitHub installs only the `aihil` CLI/MCP server. It does not install, register, or update agent skills.

If the host has no Node.js or an old Node.js, keep going by installing or activating a supported Node.js/npm runtime, then rerun `npm i -g aihil`. Current Node.js LTS is fine, but the agent does not need to pin a specific Node.js patch version; any runtime accepted by `package.json` is fine. An outdated Node.js is a remediable setup prerequisite, not a reason to refuse the AI-HIL setup. Prefer an existing version manager such as `nvm`, `fnm`, Volta, or `asdf`, or the local platform package manager such as `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` on Windows or `brew install node` on macOS. If the safe local install path is unclear, ask one concise question.

Do not use `--force`, `--ignore-engines`, or an older AI-HIL version to bypass the Node.js requirement.

From this repository checkout for AI-HIL development, install dependencies first and then link the checkout globally:

```bash
npm install
npm install --global .
```

For local AI-HIL development and tests, use the Node.js toolchain:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

If you were given only the AI-HIL repository URL and asked to set up the current firmware project, install AI-HIL with the fast path above, then return to the firmware project. Do not expect a skill to be installed, and do not vendor the AI-HIL source tree into the firmware project.

## Configure Each Project

In every firmware project that should use AI-HIL, create a project-local `.aihil/config.yaml`:

```bash
aihil init
```

Edit `.aihil/config.yaml` for the local board, OpenOCD interface, target config, allowed firmware artifact roots, and any named COM ports.

Agents should follow this workflow: use `aihil init`, edit only project-specific fields, keep safety policy restrictive, then validate with `aihil doctor`. If this source checkout is available, the optional repository-local `skills/aihil-config-setup/SKILL.md` contains the same setup workflow in skill form.

Keep `.aihil/` with the project because it defines that project's hardware policy, reports, logs, and allowed artifact locations. Do not reinstall the MCP server inside every project.

## Check Setup

```bash
aihil doctor
```

Expected healthy result: `ok: true`, `tool: "aihil_doctor"`, `summary: "AI-HIL configuration loaded and debugger checked."`, and a nested debugger result with `ok: true`.

## Configure MCP

AI-HIL uses MCP over stdio. The generated `.mcp.json` starts the installed Node entrypoint directly; this is equivalent to `aihil mcp-stdio` and avoids local `PATH` collisions.

`mcp-stdio` does not take `--port`; it is project-scoped. COM MCP tool calls pass `port_id` as tool arguments.

Project-level MCP client discovery config belongs in:

```text
.mcp.json
```

Generate it with:

```bash
aihil mcp-config > .mcp.json
```

Use the configured COM MCP tools for serial stimuli and feedback. Do not open host COM devices directly.

If the user explicitly wants a continuous plain text serial channel instead of MCP tool calls, start a separate process:

```bash
aihil com-stdio --config .aihil/config.yaml --port dut_uart
```

Do not mix plain COM text into `aihil mcp-stdio`; MCP stdio must remain JSON-RPC only. `com-stdio` is the command that requires `--port` because it binds one text stream to one configured COM port.

## Use The Tools

Use `tools/list` to discover available MCP tools, then follow this loop:

1. Build firmware.
2. Probe with `aihil_probe_target`.
3. Flash with `aihil_flash_firmware` using `image_path`, usually `build/firmware.elf`, or first call `aihil_artifact_upload` with `image_path` and flash the returned `artifact_id`.
4. For serial feedback, start `aihil_com_session_start`, send stimuli with `aihil_com_write`, read feedback with `aihil_com_read`, then stop with `aihil_com_session_stop`.
5. Read the tool result and `aihil_get_last_report`.
6. Diagnose failures with `aihil_classify_last_error`.

Do not use raw OpenOCD commands or arbitrary COM port shell tools when an AI-HIL MCP tool is available.

Healthy probe and flash signals are `target_detected: true`, `success_confirmed: true`, `verify: true`, `reset_after_flash: true`, plus `report_path` and `log_path` for auditability.
