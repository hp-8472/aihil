# AI Agent Quickstart

Use AI-HIL as the local MCP server for embedded hardware actions.

## Install Once

Install the `aihil` command once on the local machine with `pipx`:

```bash
pipx install --editable .
```

On Debian/Ubuntu systems with externally managed Python, install `pipx` through the OS package manager and do not use `--break-system-packages`:

```bash
sudo apt install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

For local AI-HIL development and tests, use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

If you were given only the AI-HIL repository URL and asked to set up the current firmware project, clone the AI-HIL repo outside the firmware project, install `aihil` from that clone, then return to the firmware project. Do not vendor the AI-HIL source tree into the firmware project.

## Configure Each Project

In every firmware project that should use AI-HIL, create a project-local `.aihil/config.yaml`:

```bash
aihil init
```

Edit `.aihil/config.yaml` for the local board, OpenOCD interface, target config, allowed firmware artifact roots, and any named COM ports.

Agents should follow `skills/aihil-config-setup/SKILL.md` for the exact setup workflow: use `aihil init`, edit only project-specific fields, keep safety policy restrictive, then validate with `aihil doctor`.

Keep `.aihil/` with the project because it defines that project's hardware policy, reports, logs, and allowed artifact locations. Do not reinstall the MCP server inside every project.

## Check Setup

```bash
aihil doctor
```

## Configure MCP

AI-HIL uses MCP over stdio. The MCP client starts `aihil mcp-stdio` automatically from `.mcp.json`.

`mcp-stdio` does not take `--port`; it is project-scoped. COM MCP tool calls pass `port_id` as tool arguments.

Project-level MCP client discovery config belongs in:

```text
.mcp.json
```

Generate it with:

```bash
aihil mcp-config > .mcp.json
```

Use the configured COM MCP tools for serial stimuli and feedback. Do not open host COM devices directly.

If the user explicitly wants a continuous plain text serial channel instead of MCP tool calls, start a separate process:

```bash
aihil com-stdio --config .aihil/config.yaml --port dut_uart
```

Do not mix plain COM text into `aihil mcp-stdio`; MCP stdio must remain JSON-RPC only. `com-stdio` is the command that requires `--port` because it binds one text stream to one configured COM port.

## Use The Tools

Use `tools/list` to discover available MCP tools, then follow this loop:

1. Build firmware.
2. Probe with `aihil_probe_target`.
3. Flash with `aihil_flash_firmware` using `image_path`, usually `build/firmware.elf`.
4. For serial feedback, start `aihil_com_session_start`, send stimuli with `aihil_com_write`, read feedback with `aihil_com_read`, then stop with `aihil_com_session_stop`.
5. Read the tool result and `aihil_get_last_report`.
6. Diagnose failures with `aihil_classify_last_error`.

Do not use raw OpenOCD commands or arbitrary COM port shell tools when an AI-HIL MCP tool is available.
